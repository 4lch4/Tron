Tron is a bot that is primarily used with Discord. It has a number of commands that make chatting a
bit more enjoyable. Such as `+hug`, `+kiss`, `+kick`, `+lick`, and much more that are listed in
the help command.

This is the 2.0/v2 rewrite of Tron that I had to start after a recent failure on the production server caused the mongo DB to go corrupt. This means Tron needs a fresh slate, so here we go.
