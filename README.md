# Purpose

Tron is a bot that is primarily used with Discord. It has a number of commands that make chatting a
bit more enjoyable. Such as `+hug`, `+kiss`, `+kick`, `+lick`, and much more that are listed in
the help command.

Tron is built using the Discord.js Commando library which greatly improves upon the previously
used Eris library. Mostly because it comes with a lot of built in tools to help make Tron more
versatile, whereas Eris is lightweight and requires you to expand on it.
